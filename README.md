# 💡 Prompt Based Website

**Prompt Based Website** is an interactive web app where the **design and behavior of the site change instantly based on user prompts**.  
For example: typing **"turn off gravity"** makes elements fall, or **"switch to dark mode"** changes the theme instantly.  

This project demonstrates modern web development, creativity, and dynamic user-driven experiences.
